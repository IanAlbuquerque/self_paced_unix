2a) Create a folder named "public_html" in your home directory. Place a 'readme.txt' file in there. (It should have the path: ~/public_html/readme.txt. Set up file permissions so that you can see the directory listing and download 'readme.txt' from the browser. What commands did you use for this?
cd ~
mkdir public_html
cd public_html
touch readme.txt
chmod 755 ~/
chmod 755 ~/public_html
chmod 755 ~/public_html/readme.txt

Setting read and execute permissions to ~, public_html and readme.txt


2b) Suppose that your working directory is your top-level directory and you give the command:

$ chmod 711 ~/public_html
Can you still view the directory listing? Can you still download readme.txt?

No. Yes.
Took read permission of public_html directory, but readme still has all its permissions.

2c) Again suppose that your working directory is your top-level directory (~/public_html has its pre-2b permissions), and you give the command:

$ chmod 600 ~/public_html/readme.txt
Can you still view the directory listing? Can you still download readme.txt?

Yes. No. Only the host can read and write on readme.txt with chmod 600. Others cant.
	
2d) Again suppose that your working directory is your top-level directory (~/public_html and ~/public_html/readme.txt have their pre-2b permissions), and you give the command:

$ chmod 700 ~/

Can you still view the directory listing? Can you still download readme.txt?

No and No.
